In JavaScript, "truthy" and "falsy" refer to how values are evaluated in a boolean context, such as in if statements or logical operations. A "truthy" value is one that evaluates to true, while a "falsy" value evaluates to false.
The following values are considered falsy in JavaScript:
false
0 (zero)
-0 (negative zero)
0n (BigInt zero)
"" (empty string)
null
undefined
NaN (Not-a-Number)
All other values are considered truthy, including: true, Any number other than 0 or -0, Any non-empty string, and Objects (including arrays and functions).
